# Contents

Scripts for analyzing simulated data, LTEE data, and two other parallel evolution data investigated in the manuscript can be found in `simulation_analysis.ipynb`, `LTEE_data_analysis.ipynb`, and `parallel_evolution_data_analysis.ipynb` notebooks respectively. Scripts for generating the figures included in the manuscript can be found in the `figures.ipynb` notebook, and references therein. Before generating files for batch jobs, please create an empty folder named `jobs` under the root directory.

Due to the large size and number of some files generated by the scripts, some data has been stored in a compressed format using Zenodo. To access the full set of data, navigate to the [Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/record/8433767). Then download and extract the contents of the archive `data.zip` as the folder `/data`.
